# Groceries

The grocery game is nothing to be proud of in Iceland. You will probably miss
this from home.

## Budget

Bónus and Krónan er the two big budget stores. Krónan has more specialty
products and more emphasis on presentation in stores that are big. Bónus has
more locations with more numerous smaller-scale ones.

There is also a Costco by the IKEA in Garðabær, but they run a franchise
arrangement where you will need to become a member to shop there (in bulk!).
Icelanders went absolutely nuts when they opened a few years ago. IKEA also
have a budget mini-market after checkout.

Other budget picks: Nettó, Super1 (newcomer),

## Upscale

Hagkaup is upscale and pack a wider range of products. This is perhaps the only
place with a butcher’s counter and cheesemonger. Some Hagkaup stores have been
around for quite a long time. They stock arts and crafts, toys and kitchen
things too.

Melabúðin, perhaps even Fjarðarkaup in Hafnarfjörður, are worth a visit. These
stores are single location and seem to have more curation of produce and
service.

## Convenience

Krambúðin are corner shops all over town. Many gas stations have some
necessities too. Independently run corner shops used to be an interesting
Icelandic subculture when video rentals were lively. Only a few survive in
Miðbær.
