Reference: reykjavik.is Note There is currently no official map of postal codes. This was taken from a post on DV.is which references a borken link on Posturinn.is. As you can see from these maps, neighborhoods don\u2019t map cleanly to postal codes. Nevertheless the neighboorhoods are frequently referred to by their primary postal codes. Famously the domestic flights airport is located very centrally, spoiling valuable land that would otherwise help reduce the need for long travel. Its area has recently been given the 102 postcode. The future of this area has been a source of political contention, but very likely the airport will gradually make way for a future central neighbourhood with mixed housing. History \u00b6 Since the war period the capital area has sprawled out with a car centric plan, especially in surrounding municipalities. Only in the last 10 years or so have the regional plans called for more walkable patterns and mixed housing areas. The result is that only Vesturb\u00e6r, Mi\u00f0borg, Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar, Laugardalur and some parts of Laugardalur are actually walkable and bike friendly. Mi\u00f0b\u00e6r (a.k.a. Downtown, 101 postcode) \u00b6 This is the downtown area and \u201eold town\u201c. This is where service, cafes, clubs and restaurants are clustered. This is by far the most touristy area with a density of high hotel and tourist accommodation. On friday and saturday nights young Icelanders travel from all over the Capital Region to party in the clubs in and around Laugavegur/Bankastr\u00e6ti.

Vesturb\u00e6r (107 postcode, with parts of 101) \u00b6 Has semi-walkable parts, the KR sports club and charming family housing. Not many offices.

Laugardalur and Brei\u00f0holt are also interesting areas.

Reference: reykjavik.is Note There is currently no official map of postal codes. This was taken from a post on DV.is which references a borken link on Posturinn.is. As you can see from these maps, neighborhoods don\u2019t map cleanly to postal codes. Nevertheless the neighboorhoods are frequently referred to by their primary postal codes. Famously the domestic flights airport is located very centrally, spoiling valuable land that would otherwise help reduce the need for long travel. Its area has recently been given the 102 postcode. The future of this area has been a source of political contention, but very likely the airport will gradually make way for a future central neighbourhood with mixed housing.","title":"Reykjav\u00edk\u2019s postal codes and neighbourhoods"},{"location":"guides/neighbourhoods/#history","text":"Since the war period the capital area has sprawled out with a car centric plan, especially in surrounding municipalities.

There's a host of organisers, events & meetups, and groups that serve the community, in addition to tech companies. Main Characteristics \u00b6 Small, but growing is probably the best way to describe it. It's characterised by several established companies, and a host of smaller ones. Recent growth in local venture capital funding has spurred a bigger number of local, funded, startups, that aim at international markets. While there are companies active in many sectors (from gaming, to developer tools, to data analysis, to fintech), the small size of the scene makes for a rather general approach, i.e. we don't have real organised sectors within the tech scene, with several exceptions. Gaming \u00b6 The gaming sector is small, but one of the few within tech that are organised. Through lobby groups like Iceland Gaming Industry and community organisers like Game Makers Iceland , there's decent visible activity. The main player in the gaming sector is CCP Games developer of EVE Online . In recent years, several other startup gaming companies have received funding and released games to some success (the jury is still out on that one), including Solid Clouds , 1939 Games . Fintech \u00b6 Similar to gaming, Icelandic fintech is small with a decisive main player - Meniga . The community is organised by organisations like the Icelandic Fintech Cluster , which both runs an office space in one of Reykjavik's \"skyscrapers\" and hosts regular events, conference trips and investor meetups, and the Icelandic Blockchain Foundation , which as the name suggests, is focused on Blockchain.

For knowledge experts it\u2019s quite possible, and for anyone else it\u2019s a long and difficult process. EU/EEA Trade agreements \u00b6 Anyone with citizenship within the EU/EEA area is allowed to relocate freely and work in Iceland without any special license or work permit. For anyone outside this area it becomes much more complicated. Worker\u2019s rights \u00b6 On paper and when enforced, worker\u2019s rights in Iceland are strong. However, many Icelandic companies do not respect worker\u2019s rights. All workers earn 24 working days of summer holiday every year. They have additional sick leave rights and cannot be asked to work an excessive amount of hours. They are entitled to appropriate clothing and security at their workplace. Look to Efling immediately if you are a non-desk worker and suspect your rights are not being observed. Expert knowledge workers \u00b6 When companies require expert knowledge workers that are hard to find in Iceland and other EEA countries, they may contract an expert and acquire a temporary work permit on their behalf. Many companies are unaware of the tax benefits available to expert foreigners moving to Iceland. The tax benefits are for the worker, so it's up to the employee to submit the application. More information on work.iceland.is/hiring-a-foreign-expert . Some (midly) interesting bits about employment in Iceland \u00b6 Minimum wage and legal stuff \u00b6 The main legal contracts surrounding employment are Collective Bargaining Agreements (is. Kjarasamningar) and then the individual agreements between employee and employer. There are no laws that mandate minimum wages or minimum benefits. They are governed through the collective agreements of labor unions and employer groups. Unions \u00b6 In many cases, employees are legally required to be part of a union, or at the minimum, pay into a union. Knowledge workers and experts usually have more control over this and can choose between unions. Unions are either for government and private market workers, and then within those two main categories, they're divided into groups and unions based on type of work and education. Pension funds & voluntary extra pension \u00b6 The pension system in Iceland is semi-privatised. This means that the pension funds are indepentent funds, but paying into them is mandatory. Employees pay between 15% and 16% of their salaries into pension funds: 4% is deducted from the salary, and the rest is paid by employer (on top of salary). The biggest part of the Icelandic labor market is bound to certain pension funds by collective agreements, but for ~40% of workers, they have a choice to pick their pension fund. Employees have the option of contributing to additional, voluntary, pension. These are similar to IRA's in the US. Up to 4% is deducted from an employees salary before tax and deposited in a pension account, and the employer is required to match up to 2% (hence a 2% salary increase). There's a host of management companies to choose from. In recent years, the government has leveraged the extra pension in creative ways, for example by allowing first time home buyers to directly deposit their extra pension into their mortgage. Note While employees are only allowed to deposit up to 4% of their salary in extra pension, employers can pay more towards the extra pension. If you're negotiating salary (and foresee that you'd like this extra pension) you can always ask for a higher percentage paid by the employer into extra pension.
